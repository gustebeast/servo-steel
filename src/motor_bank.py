"""Motor bank (§5) — PCTG. The under-string staircase.

The 10 motors lie flat under the speaking length, shaft +Y (bodies extend −Y
toward the player). They step along −X by MOTOR_X_STEP so they don't overlap,
each on its string's Y line. Each mounts to a faceplate wall (an X–Z plane at
its faceplate Y) carrying a NEMA17 pattern; the walls sit on a shared floor that
runs under the speaking length. Built in global position.
