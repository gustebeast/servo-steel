"""Adjustable pickup mount — saddle clamps + bridge bar + width jaws. PCTG.

Holds any common steel pickup (width ~22–40, length ~90–125, height ~14–25 —
e.g. a George L E-66 at 33×99×20.6) under the strings, with three adjustments:

  X (quick — bridge↔neck tone): two SADDLES clamp the chassis rails' top
    flanges, each pinched by one M4 set screw; loosen, slide the whole mount
    anywhere along the speaking length, retighten.
  Z (set once): the bar's end TABS carry vertical slots; two M4 screws per
    side into saddle-face inserts give ±6 mm — sets the string gap AND absorbs
    the pickup-height range (the pickup TOP is what the gap fixes).
  Size (per pickup): two JAWS ride a T-slot across the bar and pinch the
    pickup's WIDTH (the dimension that actually varies between models); each
    locks with a vertical M4 set screw jammed against the bar top. Length
    variants simply overhang the bar symmetrically — poles stay centred. The
    +Y rail sits only ~12 mm past string 10, so end-clamping the length has no
    jaw-travel room; width-clamping is the geometry that fits.

The bar passes OVER the belts (8 mm clear) and the assembly clears the motor
tops by ~2 mm at the bottom — no instrument-thickness increase. All hardware
is the M4 set screws + heat-set inserts + M4×12 buttons already in the BOM.

Frames: saddle local = rail centreline Y0, rail top Z0 (X-symmetric — rotate
180° about Z for the other rail). Jaw local = bar top Z0, clamp face at X0
(facing −X; rotate 180° about Z for the opposing jaw). The bar is built at its
GLOBAL Y/Z (the rails are asymmetric about the field) with X centred on 0;
build.py X-translates it to the chosen pickup position.
