"""Chassis frame (§8) — PCTG. ONE rigid frame that absorbs the motor bank and
ties in the bridge endplate and a nut keyhead, SPLIT into glued segments.

The strings pull the bridge and nut toward each other (~10×100 N) at the speaking
height, which would bow the instrument; the chassis resists that. The stiffness
comes from DEPTH: two longitudinal side rails (from just under the strings down
to the print bed) run the whole length, tied by per-motor cross-ribs and a
keyhead bulkhead at the nut. The motor faceplate walls (with their NEMA17
patterns) are fused in; the motors rest on the ribs (no floor plate). The rail
webs carry self-supporting diamond lightening; everything else is modelled
SOLID — the slicer's walls + infill set the strength-to-weight.

Too long for one print (~645 mm > 255 mm bed), so it's cut into 3 segments joined
by SLIDING DOVETAILS on the side rails: each joint's tongue flares toward +X
(locking the segments against the string pull), you drop the next segment straight
DOWN onto it (one direction), and it bottoms on a shoulder that sets the position —
then glue. The cuts fall in the ~5 mm gaps BETWEEN motor walls, so no motor
mount is split. Built in global position; the segments assemble into the whole.
