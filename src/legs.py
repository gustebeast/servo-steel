"""Adjustable legs (×4) — PCTG tubes + TPU feet/washers. Quick-attach.

Height: COARSE = how many identical stackable SEGMENTS you thread in (the
legs must print in pieces for build volume anyway, so the pieces ARE the
adjustment); FINE = a Ø20 shaft sliding in a clamped SLEEVE. One segment
steps the height by 142 (140 effective + 2 washer); the shaft slides 24–174
(150 of range > the 142 step), so adjacent bands OVERLAP and every height is
reachable: 0 segments → 241–391, 1 → 383–533, 2 → 525–675 (the user's 655 at
~154 exposure), 3 → 667–817, … Stack per leg (ground up): TPU foot → shaft →
sleeve → k× segment → the instrument SOCKET.

Quick-attach thread (per the PC-fan-screw idea): 2-start trapezoidal,
Ø36/Ø30 × 9 mm pitch (18 mm lead), 25 mm engagement = 1.4 turns. Every
junction (socket→segment, segment→segment, segment→sleeve) uses the same
thread, so legs break down for transport like real steel legs. Anti-unscrew:
a TPU WASHER under each shoulder compresses on the final quarter turn —
preload + damping; loads in play are axial (nothing torques a leg).

The SOCKET bolts to a rail's outer face (3× M4 into web inserts — stocked
hardware) with its threaded barrel hanging below the floor at the corner;
sockets sit at x −20 (bridge) and −600 (keyhead), both rails. The barrel adds
nothing inside the box and the chassis still prints flat (the socket is a
separate part precisely because the chassis can't grow below its print bed).

All printed standing (tubes along Z): threads print cleanly, no supports.
