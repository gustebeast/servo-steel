"""Overlap checker for the pedal-steel assembly.

Project glue over the shared engine in ``freecad/overlap_check.py``: this file
supplies the placed parts (``src.build.collect_components``) and the project's
``intended()`` whitelist of designed contacts (screw-in-nut, bushing-in-rail,
motor-on-bank, …); the engine runs the parallel boolean scan and reports the
UNINTENDED interpenetrations.

  py -3.12 -m tools.check_overlaps            # report unintended overlaps (parallel)
  py -3.12 -m tools.check_overlaps --all      # also list intended contacts
  py -3.12 -m tools.check_overlaps -j 14      # set worker count (default: cores/2)
  py -3.12 -m tools.check_overlaps --serial   # single-process (baseline/debug)

Exit code is the number of unintended overlapping pairs (0 = clean).

The heavy project build is imported only inside main(), so spawned workers (which
re-import this module) don't rebuild it — they just load the serialized shapes.
