"""Overlap checker for the pedal-steel assembly.

Loads every placed component from src.build.collect_components(), finds pairs
whose solids actually interpenetrate, and reports the UNINTENDED ones (skipping
designed contacts like screw-in-nut, bushing-in-rail, motor-on-bank, etc.).

  py -3.12 -m tools.check_overlaps            # report unintended overlaps
  py -3.12 -m tools.check_overlaps --all      # also list intended contacts

Exit code is the number of unintended overlapping pairs (0 = clean).
