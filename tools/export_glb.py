"""Export a SIMPLIFIED, colored GLB of the instrument for web sharing.

Writes docs/assembly.glb (served by GitHub Pages via docs/index.html, Google's
<model-viewer>). The full assembly.step is ~145 MB — far too big for in-browser
viewers — and a GLB is web-native, keeps the per-part colors, and is ~10x smaller.

This SIMPLIFIED view keeps only the instrument body, the strings, the nut block,
and the motor/changer drivetrain. It drops the legs, the deck cover plates, the
electronics + wiring, the output jacks, and the pickup, so the mechanism reads
clearly. Re-run after a design change:  py -3.12 -m tools.export_glb
